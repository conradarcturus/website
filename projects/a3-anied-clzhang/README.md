## Project Name

Visual Language Families. A language family is a group of languages related through descent from a common ancestor, called the proto-language of that family. In this project we try to visualize the language tree with greater granularity and deeper hierarchy.

## Story Board

https://github.com/CSE512-14W/a3-anied-clzhang/blob/gh-pages/a3-anied-clzhang.pdf

### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

We implement all functions we designed.


## Development Process

Include:
- Conrad and Congle writes JS/D3 codes for visualization of the wheel and the map
- Conrad creates a fine-grained language map
- Congle writes some Java code to generate Json and attributes.
- It took us a week to develop the visualization. Creating the map and debugging the javascripts cost most of our time.
